# Exercise 1: Getting started


In this section you will install Docker.

## Installing Docker

A couple other things to remember when using the server:

* Keep in mind that when accessing your containers through a browser, you will need to use the server hostname from the spreadsheet instead of ``localhost``
* These servers will be terminated shortly after the end of the academy. So if there is anything on the server you wanna save, please do it on the 4.th day.

Log in to your server, and follow [the guide on installing docker.](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-ubuntu)

By default, Docker commands will require `sudo` to run. If this bothers you, [look for extra instructions on your distro's installation page to create a `docker` user group to fix this.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/)
We assume that you have made docker non-sudo. If not, then you need to add sudo to every docker command in the examples-

After Docker finishes installing, you should start on the `crash-course` section below.

## crash-course

### Your first Docker command


If you haven't already, try running a command with Docker:

`docker run hello-world`

Your terminal output should look like this:
```
    Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
    latest: Pulling from hello-world

    a8219747be10: Pull complete
    ...
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
    Hello from Docker.
```
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

When Docker is installed on your machine and working properly, proceed to `exercise_2`.
