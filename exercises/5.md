### 2.3.4 Push your image
Now that you've created and tested your image, you can push it to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). All you have to do is:

```
docker push YOUR_USERNAME/myfirstapp
```


* `PUSH` pushes your image to Docker Hub, or alternately to a [private registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/)
